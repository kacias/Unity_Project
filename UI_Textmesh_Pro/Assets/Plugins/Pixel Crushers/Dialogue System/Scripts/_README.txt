/*
This folder contains the Dialogue System's source code. To support easy
switching between source code and compiled DLLs, the Dialogue System 
uses wrapper classes located in the Wrappers folder.

The Dialogue System uses the Pixel Crushers Common code library, located
in Plugins/Pixel Crushers/Common.

If you want to use Assembly Definitions, import DialogueSystemAssemblyDefinitions.unitypackage.
Note: If you are using TextMesh Pro (i.e., have defined the scripting 
symbol TMP_PRESENT), you will need to update the Assembly Definitions
in this folder and in Common/Scripts to reference TextMesh Pro.
If you aren't using TextMesh Pro, you can use the Assembly Definitions
as-is.
