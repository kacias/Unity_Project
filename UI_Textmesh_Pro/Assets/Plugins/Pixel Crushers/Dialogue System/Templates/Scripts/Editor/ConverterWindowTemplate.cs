        //*** This is the main conversion routine.

        //*** method edits the START nodes of all conversations and sets their Sequence fields
        //*** to None(). For example, if you know where the actors' portrait textures are,
        //*** You can also call FindPortraitTextures(database, portraitFolder), which will 
        //*** assign the actors' portrait images based on their Textures fields.

        //*** are overrideable, so you can really customize it however you want by overriding
        //*** specific methods.
