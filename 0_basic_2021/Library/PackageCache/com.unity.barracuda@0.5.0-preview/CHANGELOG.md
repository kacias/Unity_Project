- Significantly reduced temporary memory allocations by introducing internal allocator support. Now memory is re-used between layer execution as much as possible.
- Improved small workload performance on CSharp backend
- Added parallel implementation for multiple activation functions on CSharp backend
- Added `Peek()` function to `IWorker`, it retains object storage in worker's allocator, useful for quick grabbing of output. If you want to preserve content of output tensor between `Execute()` invocations, then use `Fetch()`.

- Fixed Tensor <-> Texture copy for textures/tensors that dimensions are not multiple of 8.
- Added `Summary()` method to `Worker`. Currently returns allocator information.
- Tabs to spaces! Aiming at higher salary (https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/).
- Renamed worker type enum members: `CSharp` -> `CSharpRef`, `CSharpFast` -> `CSharp`, `Compute` -> `ComputeRef`, `ComputeFast` -> `Compute`.
- Implemented new optimized `ComputePrecompiled` worker. This worker caches Compute kernels and state beforehand to reduce CPU overhead.
