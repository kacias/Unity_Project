# Skeleton sharing
You can share [.skeleton Assets](PSD-importer-properties.md#main-skeleton) between different imported Assets by assigning the .skeleton Asset from one to the other's **Main Skeleton** property. This feature can be used together with the [2D Animation package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.animation@latest) to edit the [bones](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.animation@6.0/manual/SkinEdToolsShortcuts.html#bone-tools) of the .skeleton Assets in the 2D Animation package's [Skinning Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.animation@6.0/manual/SkinningEditor.html).

To demonstrate how to skeleton sharing, refer to the following example of two actors (characters or other Assets imported for animation with the 2D Animation package) that were imported into Unity with the PSD Importer called 'Primary' and 'Variant'. The goal is to share the .skeleton Asset of 'Primary' with 'Variant'.

The [2D Animation package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.animation@latest) is required to create and edit the bones of the .skeleton Assets of imported Assets. In this example, the bones of 'Primary' are created and rigged in 2D Animation's [Skinning Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.animation@6.0/manual/SkinningEditor.html) (refer to the [2D Animation package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.animation@latest) documentation for further information).

When importing an Asset without anything set in the **Main Skeleton** property, the PSD Importer generates a .skeleton Asset for the Asset and automatically names it as '[Asset File Name] Skeleton'. Any [bones rigged](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.animation@6.0/manual/SkinEdToolsShortcuts.html#bone-tools) for 'Primary' is saved to the .skeleton Asset 'Primary Skeleton'.

To share the 'Primary Skeleton' with the 'Variant' actor, select 'Variant' and go to its PSD Importer settings. Assign 'Primary Skeleton' to the **Main Skeleton** property to have 'Variant' reference that .skeleton Asset as its own bone hierarchy.

![](images/variant-skeleton.png)<br/>The [Bone tools](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.animation@6.0/manual/SkinEdToolsShortcuts.html#bone-tools) are greyed out and unavailable when opening 'Variant' in the Skinning Editor.

When an actor references another actor's .skeleton Asset instead of its own, you cannot edit the bones of the .skeleton when you open the current actor in the Skinning Editor (the Bone tools will be grayed out and unavailable). To edit the bones, you will need to edit the original actor (which the .skeleton Asset belongs to) in the Skinning Editor. Any changes to the .skeleton Asset is reflected in the bone hierarchy of any actor which references it. In our example, changes made to 'Primary Skeleton' are reflected in the 'Variant' actor's bone hierarchy.
